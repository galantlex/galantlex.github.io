# README for Comp20
1. To the best of my knowledge, all aspects of the work have been implemented correctly
2. I sat down with Victor Cushman to talk about CSS in general, and that helped me a lot. In addition, I got a lot of help from W3Schools tutorials, and looked to Bootstrap for styling inspiration. Though this project does not use Bootstrap, I did model my navbar off of Bootstrap and W3Schools ideas.
3. I spent maybe 12 total hours on this assignment

Please note: I do have a custom domain set up for this website: galantino.pw
