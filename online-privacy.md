General Privacy Tips

1. Google your name in quotation marks, like &quot;Jane Doe&quot;. Are you comfortable with everything that shows up?
2. View your social media profiles as someone else. Make sure they only share the things you want to share!
3. Cover your webcam. This can be done with tape or a piece of a post-it, or you can get a &quot;fancy&quot; little plastic cover on Amazon that slides back and forth so you can easily uncover it when you do want to use it.
4. Put a password lock on your phone, computer, iPad, etc. If you have apps that do anything sensitive, see if you can put another password on those!
5. Do an audit of your location settings on your phone. Which apps are using your location? Do you want them to? Consider giving your location only to apps you really want to have it.
6. Consider using a password manager, like LastPass or 1Password. Then, set a randomly generated, 12+ character password for each account, and save it in your password manager. Make sure the master password on your password manager is long and complex but memorable, like a sentence!

Instagram Privacy Tips

1. Consider setting your account to &quot;private&quot;, if it isn&#39;t already. If you&#39;d like to keep your account public, that&#39;s ok, but make sure to keep in mind that public means public to the whole world.
2. Double check your &quot;share to Facebook&quot; settings. Are your Instagram posts being shared to Facebook? Do you want that? If they are, and you do want that, double check what the audience of _those_ posts is (friends vs. public).
3. Double check your Instagram Photo Map settings. The Photo Map can be great for showing off pictures of an adventurous vacation, but it can also reveal your home address, or where you spend time around your hometown. Consider turning off your Photo Map, and taking down any photos that are already there!
4. Look through the photos you&#39;ve posted, and make sure they&#39;re shared only with people you want to see them. Are there any pictures of you in front of where you live, or at your school? If so, make sure at least those photos are private, so you don&#39;t leak your home or school address. Are there photos there you want your friends to see, but not the public? Set those to private!
5. Look through your followers list. Are there folks following you who you don&#39;t want to follow you anymore? If there are, you can remove them as a follower.
6. Consider enabling the &quot;approve tagged posts&quot; feature, so that you have to give an explicit approval every time someone tags you in a post.



Snapchat Privacy Tips

1. Check your &quot;who can&quot; section- Who can contact you? Who can see your story? Who can see your location? Who can see you in &quot;quick add&quot;?
2. Check your &quot;find friends&quot; feature. In settings, click on &quot;mobile number&quot;, and then look at the box next to &quot;let others find me via my mobile number&quot;.
3. Ignore or block random users who add you.
4. Pay attention to screenshot notifications, but know that it is possible to screenshot a snapchat without sending a notification. Don&#39;t snap things you don&#39;t want screenshotted!
5. Check your settings for private snaps shared to your memories. Consider setting them to &quot;my eyes only&quot;.
6. Know how to delete stories in case you post something by accident!



Resources

- Much of the structure of this workshop was inspired by the book The Smart Girl&#39;s Guide to Privacy: Practical Tips for Staying Safe Online by Violet Blue. It can be found on Amazon or at your local library, probably. It&#39;s a bit dated and a bit unnecessarily gendered, but it&#39;s generally a good resource otherwise!
