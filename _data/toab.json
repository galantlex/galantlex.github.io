 },
 {
   "Tip": "Meal plans are wicked expensive. If you're a freshman, you don't have a choice, so abuse the heck out of that unlimited. But when you're not a freshman anymore, cut down! Swipe in for lunch and stay studying till dinner. Use the kosher deli loophole (you can go to Pax et Lox and Dewick/Carm in the same meal period). Maximize swipes by bringing tupperwares. I once made my housemates dinner using mostly ingredients I took from the salad bar in Dewick. I got one lunch and six dinners out of one swipe! \n\nAlso important: learn how to cook. Cooking saves you so much money, especially compared to the meal plans, which are upwards of $10 per meal. Eating out at Chipotle for every meal would be cheaper, even with free guac. If you learn to cook cheap, versatile, and nutritious things like rice and beans, pasta, lentils and eggs, then you can eat for a week only paying what Tufts wants to charge you for a day.\n\nMy last secret for food is the Haymarket. The Haymarket is an open-air market in downtown Boston every Friday and Saturday (rain, shine, or blizzard). It's right by the Haymarket T stop (take the Joey to Davis, the red line to Park St, then either walk 15 minutes or take the green like to Haymarket. Or make friends with someone who has a car). People there sell produce for ridiculous prices. I'm talking three heads of bananas for a dollar. Two pounds of carrots for a dollar. Eight apples for a dollar. Two giant bags of tangerines for...yep! A dollar. It's mostly either surplus produce that grocery stores don't want, or produce that's too ugly to sell, but still tastes great. Sometimes you do have to be a judicious shopper, but you can find great stuff for cheap. And it's not just generic stuff either. There's a lot of cheap seasonal produce as well as regional produce that might be more expensive in a generic grocery store. I buy plantains, yuca, and various hot peppers on the cheap from a Latina vendor who always has them stocked. Fried plantains are delicious and a touch of home, but they're also a great drunk food. And at a buck a bunch, they're much cheaper than Moe's.",

   "Tip": "Don't let financial concerns deter you from studying abroad! A lot of programs are cheaper than a semester at Tufts, and if you do a Tufts Program, your financial aid carries over. If you do a non-Tufts program, the Tufts Financial Aid office won't give you a penny (believe me, I tried), but there are other ways to pay for it! If you're a Pell Grant recipient (represent!) then you're eligible for the Gilman Scholarship, which gives students money towards studying abroad (https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/, get in touch with Anne Moore at anne.moore@tufts.edu for more info). Otherwise, it's not too hard to find third-party scholarships for students of color and female students studying abroad. There are also scholarships for students studying in \"non-traditional\" study abroad countries which according to them is basically anywhere but Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. If you do choose to do a non-Tufts program, it's probably best to direct-enroll in the foreign university rather than enroll in an American program. The American program will charge you American tuition and the foreign program will charge you foreign tuition, which is significantly lower than what they charge at Tufts. If you're not sure how to direct-enroll or if there's a language barrier, go to the study abroad office during drop-in hours. They're there to help.",
