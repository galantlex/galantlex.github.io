I am a US-based software developer, sound designer, and dancer, and I have built this website to reflect those many sides. If you are a recruiter looking to potentially hire me as an engineer, check out my [resume](/resume.pdf) or my [projects](/projects) tab, where you'll find my recent work and links to fun things on my GitHub. If you are a theatre director or a musician looking for some audio production, shoot me a message! I'll be happy to provide a portfolio and more relevant resume. If you're wondering how one could use GitHub to plan a 500-person collegiate ballroom competition, stay tuned for a blog post!
