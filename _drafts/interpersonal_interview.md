## Introduction

Name, pronouns

I work for a fairly well-known tech company in the SF Bay Area as a software engineer and interviewer. As I've been conducting interpersonal interviews, sometimes called "company values" interviews, I've noticed some pitfalls that I believe could be avoidable with some practice.

Today I'm going to first talk about the interpersonal interview in the abstract, to make sure we're all on the same page. I'll ask you what you think an interpersonal interview is, and what you think some common pitfalls may be.

**MAYBE:** I'll have you each write down a question or two, and I'll collect them.

I'll give you a practice question, and I want each one of you, individually, to practice answering it out loud. A confession: I haven't done this that exact way before, so we'll see how it goes!

Then we'll come back together, and I'll talk about some of the pitfalls I've seen, and some suggestions I have for avoiding them. I'd love to hear what you think, too!

After that, we'll split up into small groups to get some good, dedicated practice time. At this point I'll hand out some practice questions, and I'll also come around and listen in to how different groups are doing. I'd like each of you in the group to practice being an interviewer, and each to practice being interviewed. I'd like the interviewer and the observers, if any, to take some notes on things you observe.

In the end, we'll come back together and wrap up with some final thoughts.


## Code of Conduct
I'd like to treat today's session as a truly interactive workshop, not just a talk. In order to create a space where everyone here feels comfortable, I ask us all to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Show empathy towards other community members

(This CoC adapted from [the Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct))

As I said in the workshop description, this workshop today is open to all, but it will center underrepresented minorities in tech. If you are underrepresented by some part of your identity, I encourage you to take up some nice space here! That said, intersectionality is imperative, so I encourage you to leave space for your underrepresented peers as well.

A code of conduct is nothing without a method of enforcement. If you feel that there has been a violation, or if you feel uncomfortable in any way during this workshop, please feel free to email me at (email address).

## Known pitfalls
- Speaking so quickly your interviewers can't follow
  - Often they'll be taking notes; give them a chance to write the good things they're thinking about you!
- Not taking the time to understand the question
  - I've had otherwise very strong candidates
- When talking about a growth area, spinning it into a positive
  - I've heard differing opinions on this, but I'd say don't do it. Recognize that your growth area is an *actual growth area*, not just another awesome thing about you, and talk about what you're doing to improve there. Everyone has known failure modes; to tell me that you don't is to show me that you don't know yourself.

## Tips
- Practice practice practice
- Breathe
  - Possibly, have a glass of water to sip. This gives you a non-awkward excuse for some silence so you can think. Also helps with drymouth.
- Know thyself.
  - Before your interview, go over some recent projects that you've worked on, particularly ones you've worked on in groups. Think about your time in Comp20, 40, 105, or at hackathons. Have some anecdotes ready, and practice talking about them.
- Know their company
  - Try to find out their values! Some companies, like Netflix, have actually published their values. With others, you can find blog posts written by employees. Also, don't be afraid to leverage TuftsCS/WiCS's alumni network! Reach out to folks who are working or have worked at that company, and ask for a chat!

## Practice questions

- What online resources do you use to help you do your job?

- How do you keep your technology skills current?

- Pretend I’m not a tech person. Can you explain [a relevant technology] in simple terms?

- What qualities do you think are most important in a developer [or another relevant position]?

- What three words would your friends use to describe you?

- Can you tell me about a time when things didn’t go the way you wanted at work, such as a project that failed or being passed over for a promotion?

- What are your favorite and least favorite technology products, and why?

- What was the last presentation you gave?

- What are the qualities of a successful team or project leader?

- Are you comfortable working remotely or on a flexible schedule?

- What would you hope to achieve in the first six months after being hired?

- How do you manage your work-life balance?

- Why do you want to work for us?
